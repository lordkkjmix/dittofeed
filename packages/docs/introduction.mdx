Dittofeed is an open-source, omni-channel customer engagement platform for automating messages to customers via email, SMS, webhooks, and native mobile push notifications. 

Use [journeys](/resources/journeys) to automatically send templated onboarding messages, cart abandonment reminders, appointment reminders, and more with event-based triggers and branching logic. Use [broadcasts](/resources/broadcasts) for one-off messages like product updates and newsletters. Dittofeed supports both marketing and transactional messages.

Dittofeed also offers self-hosted and cloud-hosted [Embedded Components](/embedded/getting-started) that allow anyone to instantly add messaging features to their SaaS.

## What makes Dittofeed different?

Unlike Customer.io, ActiveCampaign,OneSignal, and other customer engagement platforms, Dittofeed is built from the ground up with flexibility in mind.

---

**✅ Embeddable**

With Dittofeed's [Embedded Components](/embedded/getting-started), you can embed each tool in the Dittofeed dashboard within your own SaaS. Instantly add feautures like our email template editor or our drag-and-drop journey builder to your product, for use by your customers.

Dittofeed is the only marketing automation and transactional messaging platform to offer a self-hosted embedding option, making it ideal for vertical SaaS in highly regulated industries like Health and Finance, or for any organization wanting to keep their users' PII on-prem.

---

**✅ Open Source**

Free and open-source forever. [Read our license](/guide/license).

Leave us a ⭐[github star](https://github.com/dittofeed/dittofeed)⭐ if you like what we're doing. We couldn't do it without your support!

**☑️ Git based workflows (coming soon)**

Check your messaging resources into git, make changes in a branch through the UI, and then submit a PR to github. Take advantage of the full power of git. [More Info.](/guide/git-workflows)
